# Explore File Storage

Storing data in files is fundamental to computing. Files can be stored locally on hard drives, USB drives, or centrally in shared file storage systems. Many businesses now use cloud storage for cost-effective, secure, and scalable file management.

## **File Formats**
The choice of file format depends on:
- The structure of the data (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured).
- Application requirements for reading and processing data.
- Whether the data should be human-readable or optimized for storage and efficiency.

### **Delimited Text Files**
- Data is stored in text format with field delimiters (e.g., CSV, TSV).
- Commonly used for structured data that needs human readability.

#### **Example (CSV Format):**
```csv
FirstName,LastName,Email
Emma,Smith,emma@email.com
Liam,Johnson,liam@email.com
```

### **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
- A hierarchical format used for structured and semi-structured data.
- Flexible and widely supported.

#### **Example (JSON Format):**
```json
{
  "customers": [
    {
      "firstName": "Emma",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "contact": [
        { "type": "mobile", "number": "555-789-4567" },
        { "type": "email", "address": "emma@email.com" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Liam",
      "lastName": "Johnson",
      "contact": [
        { "type": "email", "address": "liam@email.com" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**
- Uses nested elements for data representation.
- Previously popular but now often replaced by JSON.

#### **Example (XML Format):**
```xml
<Customers>
  <Customer name="Emma" lastName="Smith">
    <ContactDetails>
      <Contact type="mobile" number="555-789-4567"/>
      <Contact type="email" address="emma@email.com"/>
    </ContactDetails>
  </Customer>
  <Customer name="Liam" lastName="Johnson">
    <ContactDetails>
      <Contact type="email" address="liam@email.com"/>
    </ContactDetails>
  </Customer>
</Customers>
```

### **Binary Large Object (BLOB)**
- Stores unstructured data like images, videos, and application-specific documents.
- Requires specific applications for processing.

### **Optimized File Formats**
- **Avro**: A row-based format using JSON for schema definition and binary storage.
- **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)**: A columnar format for efficient querying in big data processing.
- **Parquet**: A highly compressed columnar format, efficient for nested data structures.

Optimized formats improve storage efficiency and query performance, making them essential for large-scale data processing.
