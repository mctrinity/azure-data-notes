# Explore Analytical Data Processing

Analytical data processing involves **read-only** or **read-mostly** systems that store vast amounts of historical data or business metrics. Analytics can be based on a snapshot of data at a specific point in time or multiple snapshots over time.

## **Key Components of Analytical Processing Systems**
1. **Data Extraction and Storage**:
   - Operational data is extracted, transformed, and loaded (**ETL**) into a **data lake** for analysis.
   - Data is structured into tables within a **data warehouse** or a **Spark-based data lakehouse** for relational querying.

2. **Data Warehousing and OLAP Processing**:
   - **Data Warehouses** store structured data optimized for **querying and reporting**.
   - **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) Models** aggregate data across dimensions for multi-level analysis (e.g., sales by region, city, or address).
   
3. **Querying and Visualization**:
   - Data from the data lake, warehouse, or OLAP model is used to generate **reports, visualizations, and dashboards**.
   
## **Comparison of Analytical Storage Solutions**
- **Data Lakes**: Store large-scale, file-based data for exploration and machine learning.
- **Data Warehouses**: Use relational schema optimized for high-performance **read** operations.
- **Data Lakehouses**: Combine **scalability** of data lakes with **relational querying** of data warehouses.

## **Users of Analytical Data Systems**
- **Data Scientists**: Explore and model data directly from the data lake.
- **Data Analysts**: Query structured data in the warehouse for insights.
- **Business Users**: Consume pre-aggregated reports and dashboards for decision-making.

## **Conclusion**
Analytical processing systems support large-scale **data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence**. Choosing between **data lakes, warehouses, and OLAP models** depends on query needs, scalability, and data complexity.
