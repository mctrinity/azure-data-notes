# Explore Databases

A database is used to define a central system in which data can be stored and queried. While file systems can store files, databases are dedicated systems for managing structured and semi-structured data records efficiently.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases are commonly used to store and query **structured data**. Data is stored in **tables** that represent entities such as customers, products, or sales orders. Each entity instance has a **primary key** that uniquely identifies it, and these keys are used to establish relationships between tables. 

### **Key Features:**
- **Normalization:** Eliminates duplicate data to maintain efficiency.
- **Referential Integrity:** Uses primary and foreign keys to link data.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL):** A standard language for querying and managing relational databases.

### **Example Schema (Relational Model):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

## Non-Relational Databases

Non-relational databases are data management systems that don’t apply a strict relational schema. These databases are often referred to as **NoSQL** databases, even though some support SQL-like querying.

### **Types of Non-Relational Databases:**

### **1. Key-Value Databases**
- Data is stored as unique **keys** and associated **values**.
- The value can be in any format (text, JSON, binary, etc.).
- **Example:** Redis, DynamoDB.

#### **Example (Key-Value Format):**
```json
{
    "user123": "{name: 'Alice', age: 30, city: 'New York'}"
}
```

### **2. Document Databases**
- A specialized form of key-value store where the **value** is a **JSON document**.
- Optimized for parsing and querying JSON data.
- **Example:** MongoDB, CouchDB.

#### **Example (Document Format):**
```json
{
    "_id": "user123",
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

### **3. Column-Family Databases**
- Stores **tabular data** (rows and columns), but columns are grouped into **families**.
- Provides high efficiency for querying large-scale datasets.
- **Example:** Apache Cassandra, HBase.

#### **Example (Column-Family Structure):**
```
Row Key | Name      | Age  | Address     
--------|----------|------|------------
123     | Alice    | 30   | New York   
124     | Bob      | 28   | Chicago    
```

### **4. Graph Databases**
- Stores data as **nodes** (entities) and **edges** (relationships between nodes).
- Optimized for querying complex relationships.
- **Example:** Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

#### **Example (Graph Model):**
```
(Alice)---[FRIENDS_WITH]-->(Bob)
(Alice)---[WORKS_AT]-->(CompanyXYZ)
```

### **Conclusion**
Databases play a crucial role in data management. While relational databases are ideal for structured data with strict schemas, non-relational databases offer flexibility for semi-structured and highly scalable applications. Choosing the right database depends on the type of data, query needs, and scalability requirements.
