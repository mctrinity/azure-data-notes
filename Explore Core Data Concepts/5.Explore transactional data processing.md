# Explore Transactional Data Processing

Transactional data processing systems record business events such as financial transactions, retail purchases, and inventory updates. These systems handle high volumes of transactions daily and require quick data access. This type of processing is known as **Online Transactional Processing (OLTP)**.

## **Key Features of OLTP Systems**
- **CRUD Operations**: Transactions involve **Creating, Retrieving, Updating, and Deleting (CRUD)** data.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity through:
  - **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
  - **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state.
  - **Isolation**: Transactions do not interfere with each other.
  - **Durability**: Committed transactions are permanent.

## **Common OLTP Applications**
- **Banking**: Processing account transactions.
- **E-commerce**: Managing orders and payments.
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock tracking.
- **Airline Reservations**: Ticket booking and availability updates.

## **Conclusion**
OLTP systems enable fast and reliable transaction processing for real-time business operations. Their ACID properties ensure data consistency and durability, making them essential for high-performance, data-driven applications.
