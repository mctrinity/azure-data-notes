# Identifying Data Formats

Data consists of facts used to store and share information, typically structured to represent entities like customers, products, or sales orders.

## **Types of Data**

### **1. Structured Data**
- Organized with a fixed schema, usually in **tables** (rows and columns).
- Commonly stored in **relational databases** with relationships between tables.

### **2. Semi-structured Data**
- Has some structure but allows variations.
- Often stored in **JSON format**, where entity attributes can differ between records.

#### **JSON Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "firstName": "Emma",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "address": {
      "street": "500 Oak Ave",
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "state": "CA"
    },
    "contact": [
      { "type": "mobile", "number": "555-789-4567" },
      { "type": "email", "address": "emma.smith@email.com" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "firstName": "Liam",
    "lastName": "Johnson",
    "address": {
      "street": "742 Maple St",
      "city": "New York",
      "state": "NY"
    },
    "contact": [
      { "type": "home", "number": "555-123-9876" },
      { "type": "email", "address": "liam.johnson@email.com" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### **3. Unstructured Data**
- No predefined format; includes **documents, images, videos, and audio files**.

## **Data Storage Types**
Businesses store data in various ways for reporting and analysis:

1. **File Stores** – For documents, images, and other unstructured data.
2. **Databases** – For structured and semi-structured data.

Each storage method is suited for specific business needs and data processing requirements.
