# Explore File Storage

The ability to store data in files is a core element of any computing system. Files can be stored in local file systems on the hard disk of your personal computer, and on removable media such as USB drives; but in most organizations, important data files are stored centrally in some kind of shared file storage system. Increasingly, that central storage location is hosted in the cloud, enabling cost-effective, secure, and reliable storage for large volumes of data.

## File Formats

The specific file format used to store data depends on a number of factors, including:

- The type of data being stored (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured).
- The applications and services that will need to read, write, and process the data.
- The need for the data files to be readable by humans, or optimized for efficient storage and processing.

### Delimited Text Files

Data is often stored in plain text format with specific field delimiters and row terminators. The most common format for delimited data is **comma-separated values (CSV)**. Other formats include tab-separated values (TSV) and fixed-width data.

#### **Example (CSV Format):**
```csv
FirstName,LastName,Email
Joe,Jones,joe@litware.com
Samir,Nadoy,samir@northwind.com
```

### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

JSON is a hierarchical document format that defines data entities with multiple attributes. It is flexible and supports structured and semi-structured data.

#### **Example (JSON Format):**
```json
{
  "customers": [
    {
      "firstName": "Joe",
      "lastName": "Jones",
      "contact": [
        { "type": "home", "number": "555 123-1234" },
        { "type": "email", "address": "joe@litware.com" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Samir",
      "lastName": "Nadoy",
      "contact": [
        { "type": "email", "address": "samir@northwind.com" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extensible Markup Language (XML)

XML is a structured format that was widely used before JSON became popular. It defines data using nested elements enclosed in angle brackets.

#### **Example (XML Format):**
```xml
<Customers>
  <Customer name="Joe" lastName="Jones">
    <ContactDetails>
      <Contact type="home" number="555 123-1234"/>
      <Contact type="email" address="joe@litware.com"/>
    </ContactDetails>
  </Customer>
  <Customer name="Samir" lastName="Nadoy">
    <ContactDetails>
      <Contact type="email" address="samir@northwind.com"/>
    </ContactDetails>
  </Customer>
</Customers>
```

### Binary Large Object (BLOB)

BLOB files store unstructured data such as images, video, audio, and application-specific documents in raw binary form. These files are often not human-readable and require specific applications for interpretation.

### Optimized File Formats

While human-readable formats are useful, optimized formats provide compression, indexing, and efficient storage. Some common optimized file formats include:

- **Avro**: A row-based format using JSON for headers and binary for data.
- **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar format)**: A columnar format optimized for Apache Hive.
- **Parquet**: A columnar format designed for efficient nested data processing and high compression rates.

These formats are used in big data processing to reduce storage costs and improve query performance.
