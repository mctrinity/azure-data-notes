# Understanding Normalization

**Normalization** is a database schema design process that **reduces data duplication** and ensures **data integrity**.

## **Key Principles of Normalization**
1. **Separate Entities into Tables** – Each entity (e.g., customer, product, order) should have its own table.
2. **Each Attribute in Its Own Column** – Avoid combining multiple data points in a single field.
3. **Use Primary Keys** – Uniquely identify each row in a table.
4. **Use Foreign Keys** – Establish relationships between tables.

## **Benefits of Normalization**
- **Eliminates Redundant Data** – Prevents unnecessary data duplication.
- **Improves Data Integrity** – Ensures changes are only made in a single location.
- **Enhances Query Efficiency** – Enables precise filtering and analysis.

## **Example: Before & After Normalization**
### **Unnormalized Table (Inefficient Storage)**
- A single table storing **orders, customers, and products**, leading to data redundancy.

### **Normalized Schema (Efficient Storage)**
- Separate tables for **Customers, Products, Orders, and Line Items**, with relationships established through **primary and foreign keys**.

Relational databases enforce **referential integrity**, ensuring foreign keys match valid primary keys, preventing issues like orders linked to non-existent customers.

Normalization structures data logically, making databases more **efficient, scalable, and easier to maintain**.
