# Understanding Relational Data

In a **relational database**, real-world entities are represented as **tables**, where each table stores data about a specific entity (e.g., customers, products, orders).

## **Key Concepts**
- **Entities & Tables**: Each table represents an entity, and each row corresponds to a single instance of that entity.
- **Columns & Data Types**:
  - Each column stores **specific data types** (e.g., text, numeric, date/time).
  - Some columns may allow **NULL** values (e.g., a middle name that may not exist for all customers).
- **Structured Format**:
  - Tables follow a consistent structure, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
  - Standardized **ANSI data types** are used across most relational databases.

Relational databases provide a **flexible and structured** way to organize data, making it easy to query, analyze, and maintain.
