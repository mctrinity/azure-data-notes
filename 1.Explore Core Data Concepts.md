# Identifying Data Formats  

Data is a collection of facts used to record information, often structured to represent entities (e.g., customers, products, sales orders) with specific attributes.

## Types of Data

### 1. Structured Data  
- Organized in a fixed schema, typically in **tabular format** (rows and columns).  
- Often stored in **relational databases**, where tables reference each other via key values.  

### 2. Semi-structured Data  
- Contains some structure but allows for variations.  
- Commonly represented in **JSON**, where entity attributes may differ between instances.  
- Example: Customer records where some have multiple email addresses while others have none.  

#### **JSON Example**
```json
// Customer 1
{
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Jones",
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "1 Main St.",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10099"
  },
  "contact": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 123-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "joe@litware.com"
    }
  ]
}

// Customer 2
{
  "firstName": "Samir",
  "lastName": "Nadoy",
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "123 Elm Pl.",
    "unit": "500",
    "city": "Seattle",
    "state": "WA",
    "postalCode": "98999"
  },
  "contact": [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "samir@northwind.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Unstructured Data  
- Lacks a defined format, including **documents, images, audio, video, and binary files**.  

## Data Storage Types  
Organizations store data in different formats for analysis and reporting, primarily in:  

1. **File Stores:** Used for documents, images, and other unstructured data.  
2. **Databases:** Used for structured and semi-structured data.  

Further exploration of these storage types follows in later topics.
